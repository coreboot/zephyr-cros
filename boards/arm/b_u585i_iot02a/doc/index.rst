Programming and Debugging
*************************

Flashing
========

B_U585I_IOT02A Discovery kit includes an ST-LINK/V2-1 embedded debug tool interface.
This interface is supported by the openocd version included in Zephyr SDK.

Flashing an application to B_U585I_IOT02A Discovery kit
-------------------------------------------------------

Connect the B_U585I_IOT02A Discovery kit to your host computer using the USB
port, then run a serial host program to connect with your Discovery
board. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Then, build and flash in the usual way. Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: b_u585i_iot02a
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! arm

Debugging
=========

Debugging
=========

STM32U5 support is not currently supported in openocd. As a temporary workaround,
user can use `STMicroelectronics customized version of OpenOCD`_ to debug the
the B_U585I_IOT02A Discovery kit.
For this you need to fetch this repo, checkout branch "openocd-cubeide-r3" and
build openocd following the instructions provided in the README of the project.
Then, build zephyr project indicating the openocd location in west build command.

Here is an example for the :ref:`blinky-sample` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: b_u585i_iot02a
   :gen-args: -DOPENOCD="<path_to_openocd>/openocd/src/openocd" -DOPENOCD_DEFAULT_PATH="<path_to_openocd>/openocd/tcl/"
   :goals: build

Then, indicate openocd as the chosen runner in flash and debug commands:


   .. code-block:: console

      $ west flash -r openocd
      $ west debug -r openocd
