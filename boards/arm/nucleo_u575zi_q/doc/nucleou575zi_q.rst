Programming
***********

Applications for the ``nucleo_u575zi_q`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

Board is configured to be flashed using west STM32CubeProgrammer runner.
Installation of `STM32CubeProgrammer`_ is then required to flash the board.


Flashing an application to Nucleo U575ZI Q
------------------------------------------

Connect the Nucleo U575ZI Q to your host computer using the USB port.
Then build and flash an application. Here is an example for the
:ref:`hello_world` application.

Run a serial host program to connect with your Nucleo board:

.. code-block:: console

   $ minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0

Then build and flash the application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: nucleo_u575zi_q
   :goals: build flash

You should see the following message on the console:

.. code-block:: console

   Hello World! arm

Debugging
=========

STM32U5 support is not currently supported in openocd. As a temporary workaround,
user can use `STMicroelectronics customized version of OpenOCD`_ to debug the
the Nucleo U575ZI Q.
For this you need to fetch this repo, checkout branch "openocd-cubeide-r3" and
build openocd following the instructions provided in the README of the project.
Then, build zephyr project indicating the openocd location in west build command.

Here is an example for the :ref:`blinky-sample` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: nucleo_u575zi_q
   :gen-args: -DOPENOCD="<path_to_openocd>/openocd/src/openocd" -DOPENOCD_DEFAULT_PATH="<path_to_openocd>/openocd/tcl/"
   :goals: build

Then, indicate openocd as the chosen runner in flash and debug commands:


   .. code-block:: console

      $ west flash -r openocd
      $ west debug -r openocd
