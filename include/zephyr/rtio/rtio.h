/**
 * @file
 * @brief Real-Time IO device API for moving bytes with low effort
 *
 * RTIO uses a SPSC lock-free queue pair to enable a DMA and ISR friendly I/O API.
 *
 * I/O like operations are setup in a pre-allocated queue with a fixed number of
 * submission requests. Each submission request takes the device to operate on
 * and an operation. The rest is information needed to perform the operation such
 * as a register or mmio address of the device, a source/destination buffers
 * to read from or write to, and other pertinent information.
 *
 * These operations may be chained in a such a way that only when the current
 * operation is complete will the next be executed. If the current request fails
 * all chained requests will also fail.
 *
 * The completion of these requests are pushed into a fixed size completion
 * queue which an application may actively poll for completions.
 *
 * An executor (could use a dma controller!) takes the queues and determines
 * how to perform each requested operation. By default there is a software
 * executor which does all operations in software using software device
 * APIs.
