# Properties for the serial 1-Wire master driver:
# No GPIOs need to be configured here, as this is already done in the serial
# driver. Typically 2 IOs are needed, but some microcontrollers have
# the option for a "single-wire Half-duplex" mode, where the TX and RX lines
# are internally connected, such that only a single IO
# needs to be allocated for the 1-Wire communication.
