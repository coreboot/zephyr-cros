  NXP S32 eMIOS PWM node for S32 SoCs. Each channel in eMIOS can be configured
  to use for PWM operation. There are several PWM modes supported by this module,
  some modes only support on channels that have internal counter, some modes
  require to use a reference timebase from a master bus.

  For example to configuring eMIOS instance 0 with channel 0 for mode OPWFMB, channel 1
  for mode OPWMB and channel 2 for mode OPWMCB with deadtime inserted at leading edge:
    emios0_pwm: pwm {
      pwm_0 {
        channel = <0>;
        pwm-mode = "MODE_OPWFMB";
        prescaler = <8>;
        period = <65534>;
        duty-cycle = <32768>;
        polarity = "ACTIVE_HIGH";
      };

      pwm_1 {
        channel = <1>;
        master-bus = <&emios1_bus_a>;
        pwm-mode = "MODE_OPWMB";
        duty-cycle = <32768>;
        phase-shift = <100>;
        polarity = "ACTIVE_LOW";
      };

      pwm_2 {
        channel = <2>;
        master-bus = <&emios1_bus_b>;
        pwm-mode = "MODE_OPWMCB_LEAD_EDGE";
        duty-cycle = <32768>;
        dead-time = <100>;
        polarity = "ACTIVE_LOW";
      };
    };

  OPWMB and OPWMCB modes use reference timebase, the master bus is chosen over
  phandle 'master-bus'. For OPWMB mode, PWM's period is master bus's period and
  is 2 * master bus's period - 2 for OPWMCB mode. Please notice that the devicetree
  node for master bus should be enabled and configured for using, please see
  'nxp,s32-emios' bindings.

      description: |
        Select PWM mode:
        - OPWFMB: provides waveforms with variable duty cycle and frequency,
                  this mode uses internal counter.

        - OPWMB:  generate pulses with programmable leading and trailing
                  edge placement. The period is determined by period of
                  an external counter driven in MCB Up Mode. Changing PWM period
                  at runtime will impact to all channels share the same timebase.
                  The new period and cycle take effect in next period boundary.

        - OPWMCB: generates a center aligned PWM with dead time insertion to the
                  leading or trailing edge. The period is determined by period of
                  an external counter driven in MCB Up Down Mode. Changing PWM period
                  at runtime will impact to all channels share the same timebase,
                  The new period and cycle take effect in next period boundary.
