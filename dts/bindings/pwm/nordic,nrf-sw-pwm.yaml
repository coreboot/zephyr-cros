    clock-prescaler:
      type: int
      description: |
        Clock prescaler for RTC or TIMER used for generating PWM output signals.

        RTC: needs to be set to 0, which gives 32768 Hz base clock for PWM
        generation.

        TIMER: 16 MHz / 2^prescaler base clock is used for PWM generation.
      required: true
