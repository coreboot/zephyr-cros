      DRDY pin

      This pin defaults to active high when produced by the sensor.
      The property value should ensure the flags properly describe
      the signal that is presented to the driver.

  drdy-pulsed:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Selects the pulsed mode for data-ready interrupt when enabled,
      and the latched mode when disabled.

  odr:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
        Specify the output data rate expressed in samples per second (Hz).
        The default is the power-on reset value.

        0 = Power-Down
        1 = 1Hz
        2 = 4Hz
        3 = 10Hz
        4 = 25Hz
        5 = 50Hz
        6 = 75Hz
        7 = 100Hz
        8 = 200Hz

  lpf:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
        Specify the low pass filter value to be applied to pressure data.
        The default is the power-on reset value.

        0 = Low Pass Filter disabled
        1 = Low Pass Filter set to ODR/4

  avg:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
        Specify the average filter value (i.e. number of samples) to be applied
        to pressure and temperature data.
        The default is the power-on reset value.

        0 = Average of 4 data samples
        1 = Average of 8 data samples
        2 = Average of 16 data samples
