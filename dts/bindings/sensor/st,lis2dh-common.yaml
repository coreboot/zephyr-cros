      The INT1 and (optional) INT2 signal connections.  These signals
      are active-high as produced by the sensor.

  int1-gpio-config:
    type: int

    description: |
      Select the interrupt configuration for INT1 gpio.

      0 = GPIO_INT_EDGE

      2 = GPIO_INT_EDGE_FALLING
      3 = GPIO_INT_LEVEL_HIGH
      4 = GPIO_INT_LEVEL_LOW

      The default of 0 is the most common situation to avoid multiple interrupts
      to be triggered by same event.

  disconnect-sdo-sa0-pull-up:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates the device driver should disconnect SDO/SA0 pull-up
      during device initialization (e.g. to save current
      leakage). Note that only subset of devices supported by this
      binding have SDO/SA0 pull-up (e.g. LIS2DH12, LIS3DH).

  anym-on-int1:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates that the device driver should use interrupt 1
      for any movement. This is for boards that only have one
      interrupt line connected from the sensor to the processor.

  anym-no-latch:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Disable the latching of interrupts for any movement.

  anym-mode:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Select the interrupt mode for any movement.

      0 = OR combination of interrupt events
      1 = 6D movement recognition
      2 = AND combination of interrupt events
      3 = 6D position recognition

      The default of 0 is the power-on-reset value.
