    When setting the accel-range, accel-odr, properties in a .dts or .dtsi
    file you may include lis2du12.h and use the macros defined there.

    Example:
    #include <zephyr/dt-bindings/sensor/lis2du12.h>

    lis2du12: lis2du12@0 {
      ...

      accel-range = <LSM6DSV16X_DT_FS_8G>;
      accel-odr = <LSM6DSV16X_DT_ODR_AT_60Hz>;
    };

include: sensor-device.yaml

properties:
  int1-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      INT1 pin

      This pin defaults to active high when produced by the sensor.
      The property value should ensure the flags properly describe
      the signal that is presented to the driver.

  int2-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      INT2 pin

      This pin defaults to active high when produced by the sensor.
      The property value should ensure the flags properly describe
      the signal that is presented to the driver.

  drdy-pin:
    type: int
    default: 1
    description: |
      Select DRDY pin number (1 or 2).

      1 = drdy is generated from INT1
      2 = drdy is generated from INT2

      This number represents which of the two interrupt pins
      (INT1 or INT2) the drdy line is attached to. This property is not
      mandatory and if not present it defaults to 1 which is the
      configuration at power-up.
    enum: [1, 2]

  accel-range:
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      Range in g. Default is power-up configuration.

      0 # LIS2DU12_DT_FS_2G  (0.061 mg/LSB)
      1 # LIS2DU12_DT_FS_4G  (0.122 mg/LSB)
      2 # LIS2DU12_DT_FS_8G  (0.244 mg/LSB)
      3 # LIS2DU12_DT_FS_16G (0.488 mg/LSB)

    enum: [0, 1, 2, 3]

  accel-odr:
    type: int
    default: 0x0
    description: |
      Specify the default accelerometer output data rate expressed in samples per second (Hz).
      The values are taken in accordance to lis2du12_md_t enumerative in hal/st
      module. Please note that this values will also enable/disable High performance mode.
      Default is power-up configuration.

  drdy-pulsed:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Selects the pulsed mode for data-ready interrupt when enabled,
      and the latched mode when disabled.
