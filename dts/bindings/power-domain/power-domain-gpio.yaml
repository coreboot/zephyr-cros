description: Simple GPIO controlled power domain

compatible: "power-domain-gpio"

include: power-domain.yaml

properties:
  enable-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    required: true
    description: |
      GPIO to use to enable/disable the regulator.

      Unlike the gpio property in the Linux bindings this array must
      provide the GPIO polarity and open-drain status in the phandle
      selector.  The Linux enable-active-high and gpio-open-drain
      properties are not valid for Zephyr devicetree files.

  enable-pin-high-drive:
    type: boolean
    description:
      Drive the enable pin with the highest possible drive strength.
      This is useful when the enable pin is used as the power source
      itself.

  startup-delay-us:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 0
    description: Startup time, in microseconds

  off-on-delay-us:
    type: int
    required: false
    default: 0
    description: Off delay time, in microseconds

  init-priority:
    type: int
    default: 75
    description: |
      Device initialisation priority. Powre domains that depend on other
      power domains must be initiliased AFTER the dependant domain.
