  nxp,loopback:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable loopback mode on LPUART peripheral. When present, RX pin is
      disconnected, and transmitter output is internally connected to
      the receiver input.

  single-wire:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable the single wire half-duplex communication.
      Using this mode, TX and RX lines are internally connected and
      only TX pin is used afterwards and should be configured.
      RX/TX conflicts must be handled on user side.

  tx-invert:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Invert the binary logic of tx pin. When enabled, physical logic levels are inverted and
      we use 1=Low, 0=High instead of 1=High, 0=Low.

  rx-invert:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Invert the binary logic of rx pin. When enabled, physical logic levels are inverted and
      we use 1=Low, 0=High instead of 1=High, 0=Low.

  nxp,rs485-mode:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Set to enable RTS signal, which can be used to enable the driver
      of an external RS-485 transceiver. Note hw-flow-control should be
      set to false.

  nxp,rs485-de-active-low:
    type: boolean
    description: RTS polarity at RS485 mode.
