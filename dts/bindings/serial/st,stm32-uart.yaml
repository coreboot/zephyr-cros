properties:
    reg:
      required: true

    interrupts:
      required: true

    single-wire:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: |
        Enable the single wire half-duplex communication.
        Using this mode, TX and RX lines are internally connected and
        only TX pin is used afterwards and should be configured.
        RX/TX conflicts must be handled on user side.

    tx-invert:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: |
        Invert the binary logic of tx pin. When enabled, physical logic levels are inverted and
        we use 1=Low, 0=High instead of 1=High, 0=Low.

    rx-invert:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: |
        Invert the binary logic of rx pin. When enabled, physical logic levels are inverted and
        we use 1=Low, 0=High instead of 1=High, 0=Low.

    pinctrl-0:
      required: true

    pinctrl-names:
      required: true
