  hw-rs485-hd-mode:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Enable the hardware RS485 half duplex mode.
      Overrides hw-flow-control if both are set.
      Using this mode, the pin assigned to DTR
      is asserted during transmission.

  tx-invert:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Invert the binary logic of tx pin. When enabled, physical logic levels are inverted and
      we use 1=Low, 0=High instead of 1=High, 0=Low.

  rx-invert:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Invert the binary logic of rx pin. When enabled, physical logic levels are inverted and
      we use 1=Low, 0=High instead of 1=High, 0=Low.
