        Determines the division ratio of a kernel clock pre-scaler
        producing UCPD peripheral clock (ucpd_clk). It is recommended
        to use the pre-scaler so as to set the ucpd_clk frequency in
        the range from 6 to 9 MHz.

        Determines the division ratio of a ucpd_clk divider producing
        inter-frame gap timer clock (tInterFrameGap).
        The division ratio 15 is to apply for Tx clock at the USB PD 2.0
        specification nominal value.
        Valid range: 2 - 32

        Determines the division ratio of a hbit_clk divider producing
        tTransitionWindow interval.
        Valid range: 2 - 32

        Determines the division ratio of a ucpd_clk divider producing
        half-bit clock (hbit_clk)
        Valid range: 1 - 64
