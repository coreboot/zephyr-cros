Bridge Configuration Server
###########################

The Bridge Configuration Server model is a foundation model defined by the Bluetooth Mesh
specification. It is an optional model, enabled with the
:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_BRG_CFG_SRV` configuration option. This model extends
the :ref:`bluetooth_mesh_models_cfg_srv` model.

The Bridge Configuration Server model was introduced in the Bluetooth Mesh Protocol Specification
version 1.1, and is used for supporting and configuring the Subnet Bridge feature.

The Bridge Configuration Server model relies on a :ref:`bluetooth_mesh_models_brg_cfg_cli` to
configure it. The Bridge Configuration Server model only accepts messages encrypted with the nodeâ€™s
device key.

If present, the Bridge Configuration Server model must be instantiated on the primary element.

The Bridge Configuration Server model provides access to the following three states:

* **Subnet Bridge state**: This state enables or disables the Subnet Bridge feature on a node. When
  the Subnet Bridge feature is enabled on a node, the node can transfer received messages from one
  subnet to another as specified by the Bridging Table state.

* **Bridging Table state**: This state holds the bridging table. This table is used to check if
  incoming messages can be bridged from one subnet to another. The maximum number of rows supported
  by the Bridging Table state can be configured using the
  :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_MESH_BRG_TABLE_ITEMS_MAX` configuration option.

* **Bridging Table Size state**: This state reports the maximum number of rows supported by the
  Bridging Table state. This is a read-only state.
