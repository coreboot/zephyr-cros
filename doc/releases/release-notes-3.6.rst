Build system and infrastructure
*******************************

* Added functionality for Link Time Optimization.
  This change includes interrupt script generator rebuilding and adding following options:

  - :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ISR_TABLES_LOCAL_DECLARATION` Kconfig option:
    LTO compatible interrupt tables parser,
  - :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTO` Kconfig option: Enable Link Time Optimization.

  Currently the LTO compatible interrupt tables parser is only supported by ARM architectures and
  GCC compiler/linker.
  See `pull request :github:`66392` for details.

* Dropped the ``COMPAT_INCLUDES`` option, it was unused since 3.0.

* Fixed an issue whereby board revision ``0`` did not include overlay files for that revision.

* Added ``PRE_IMAGE_CMAKE`` and ``POST_IMAGE_CMAKE`` hooks to sysbuild modules, which allows for
  modules to run code after and before each image's cmake invocation.

* Added :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ROM_END_OFFSET` option which allows reducing the size of an image,
  this is intended for use with firmware signing scripts which add additional data to the end of
  images outside of the build itself.

* Added MCUboot image size reduction to sysbuild images which include MCUboot which prevents
  issues with building firmware images that are too large for MCUboot to swap.

* Deprecated :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_SRAM_SIZE`, users of this should transition to
  having RAM set up properly in their board devicetree files.

* Fixed an issue whereby shields were processed in order of the root they resided in rather than
  the order they were supplied to cmake in.

* Fixed an issue whereby using some shields with sysbuild would cause a cmake Kconfig error.

* Fixed an issue where the macros ``_POSIX_C_SOURCE`` and ``_XOPEN_SOURCE`` would be defined
  globally when building with Picolibc or for the native (``ARCH_POSIX``) targets.
  After this change users may need to define them for their own applications or libraries if they
  require them.

* Added support for sysbuild setting a signing script (``SIGNING_SCRIPT``), see
  :ref:`west-extending-signing` for details.

* Added support for ``FILE_SUFFIX`` in the build system which allows for adding suffixes to
  application Kconfig fragment file names and devicetree overlay file names, see
  :ref:`application-file-suffixes` and :ref:`sysbuild_file_suffixes` for details.

* Deprecated ``CONF_FILE`` ``prj_<build>.conf`` build type.

Libraries / Subsystems
**********************

* Management

  * Fixed an issue in MCUmgr image management whereby erasing an already erased slot would return
    an unknown error, it now returns success.

  * Fixed MCUmgr UDP transport structs being statically initialised, this results in about a
    ~5KiB flash saving.

  * Fixed an issue in MCUmgr which would cause a user data buffer overflow if the UDP transport was
    enabled on IPv4 only but IPv6 support was enabled in the kernel.

  * Implemented datetime functionality in MCUmgr OS management group, this makes use of the RTC
    driver API.

  * Fixed an issue in MCUmgr console UART input whereby the FIFO would be read outside of an ISR,
    which is not supported in the next USB stack.

  * Fixed an issue whereby the ``mcuboot erase`` DFU shell command could be used to erase the
    MCUboot or currently running application slot.

  * Fixed an issue whereby messages that were too large to be sent over the UDP transport would
    wrongly return :c:enum:`MGMT_ERR_EINVAL` instead of :c:enum:`MGMT_ERR_EMSGSIZE`.

  * Fixed an issue where confirming an image in Direct XIP mode would always confirm the image in
    the primary slot even when executing from the secondary slot, now the currently active image is
    always confirmed.

  * Added support for retrieving registered command groups, to support registering and deregistering
    default command groups at runtime, allowing an application to support multiple implementations
    for the same command group.

  * Fixed an issue in MCUmgr FS management whereby the semaphore lock would not be given if an
    error was returned, leading to a possible deadlock.

  * Added support for custom payload MCUmgr handlers, this can be enabled with
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_MGMT_CUSTOM_PAYLOAD`.

  * Fixed an issue in MCUmgr image management whereby an error would be returned if a command was
    sent to erase the slot which was already erased.

  * Added support for image slot size checking to ensure an update can be utilised by MCUboot,
    this can be performed by using sysbuild when building both application and MCUboot by enabling
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_GRP_IMG_TOO_LARGE_SYSBUILD` or by use of bootloader information
    sharing from MCUboot by enabling
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_GRP_IMG_TOO_LARGE_BOOTLOADER_INFO`.

* File systems

* Modem modules

* Power management

  * Atmel SAM: introduced SUPC functions to allow wakeup sources and poweroff.

* Retention

  * Fixed issue whereby :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_RETENTION_BUFFER_SIZE` values over 256 would cause
    an infinite loop due to use of 8-bit variables.

* Storage

  * File systems: LittleFS module has been updated to version 2.8.1.

  * Following Flash Map API macros, marked in 3.2 as deprecated, have been removed:

    ``FLASH_AREA_LABEL_EXISTS`` and ``FLASH_AREA_DEVICE``.

* Binary descriptors

* POSIX API

  * conformance: complete support for ``POSIX_THREADS_EXT``, ``XSI_THREADS_EXT``,
    ``POSIX_CLOCK_SELECTION``, and ``POSIX_SEMAPHORES`` Option Groups.

  * semaphores: add support for named semaphores

  * shell: add a top-level ``posix`` command in the Zephyr shell. Zephyr shell utilities for
    the POSIX API can be added as subcommands (e.g. ``posix uname -a``)

  * timers: use async thread cancellation, add support for ``SIGEV_THREAD``, ``CLOCK_REALTIME``

  * unistd: add compile-time-constant sysconf() implementation

* LoRa/LoRaWAN

Tests and Samples
*****************

* :ref:`native_sim<native_sim>` has replaced :ref:`native_posix<native_posix>` as the default
  test platform.
  :ref:`native_posix<native_posix>` remains supported and used in testing but will be deprecated
  in a future release.

* Bluetooth split stacks tests, where the BT host and controller are run in separate MCUs, are
  now run in CI based on the :ref:`nrf5340_bsim<nrf5340bsim>` targets.
  Several other runtime AMP tests based on these targets have been added to CI, including tests
  of OpenAMP, the mbox and IPC drivers/subsystem, and the logger multidomain functionality.

* Runtime UART tests have been added to CI based on the :ref:`nrf52_bsim<nrf52_bsim>` target.
  These include tests of the nRFx UART driver and networked BT stack tests with the host and
  controller in separate devices communicating over the HCI UART driver.

* Fixed an issue in :zephyr:code-sample:`smp-svr` sample whereby if USB was already initialised,
  application would fail to boot properly.

* Added a LVGL sample :zephyr:code-sample:`lvgl-accelerometer-chart` showcasing displaying of live
  sensor data in a chart widget.
