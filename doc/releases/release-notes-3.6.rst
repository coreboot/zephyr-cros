* Audio

  * Changed ``bt_bap_scan_delegator_subgroup`` to :c:struct:`bt_bap_bass_subgroup` and
    made it independent of :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_BAP_SCAN_DELEGATOR`.
  * Modified :c:func:`bt_bap_stream_send` to no longer take a timestamp as parameter,
    and added :c:func:`bt_bap_stream_send_ts` that does.
  * Modified :c:func:`bt_cap_stream_send` to no longer take a timestamp as parameter,
    and added :c:func:`bt_cap_stream_send_ts` that does.
  * Assigned number values have been moved from :file:`include/zephyr/bluetooth/audio/lc3.h` to
    :file:`include/zephyr/bluetooth/audio/audio.h` and the ``LC3`` infix have been removed.

Build system and infrastructure
*******************************

* Added functionality for Link Time Optimization.
  This change includes interrupt script generator rebuilding and adding following options:

  - :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ISR_TABLES_LOCAL_DECLARATION` Kconfig option:
    LTO compatible interrupt tables parser,
  - :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LTO` Kconfig option: Enable Link Time Optimization.

  Currently the LTO compatible interrupt tables parser is only supported by ARM architectures and
  GCC compiler/linker.
  See `pull request :github:`66392` for details.

* Dropped the ``COMPAT_INCLUDES`` option, it was unused since 3.0.

* Fixed an issue whereby board revision ``0`` did not include overlay files for that revision.

* Added ``PRE_IMAGE_CMAKE`` and ``POST_IMAGE_CMAKE`` hooks to sysbuild modules, which allows for
  modules to run code after and before each image's cmake invocation.

* Added :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ROM_END_OFFSET` option which allows reducing the size of an image,
  this is intended for use with firmware signing scripts which add additional data to the end of
  images outside of the build itself.

* Added MCUboot image size reduction to sysbuild images which include MCUboot which prevents
  issues with building firmware images that are too large for MCUboot to swap.

* Deprecated :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_SRAM_SIZE`, users of this should transition to
  having RAM set up properly in their board devicetree files.

* Fixed an issue whereby shields were processed in order of the root they resided in rather than
  the order they were supplied to cmake in.

* Fixed an issue whereby using some shields with sysbuild would cause a cmake Kconfig error.

* Fixed an issue where the macros ``_POSIX_C_SOURCE`` and ``_XOPEN_SOURCE`` would be defined
  globally when building with Picolibc or for the native (``ARCH_POSIX``) targets.
  After this change users may need to define them for their own applications or libraries if they
  require them.

* Added support for sysbuild setting a signing script (``SIGNING_SCRIPT``), see
  :ref:`west-extending-signing` for details.

* Added support for ``FILE_SUFFIX`` in the build system which allows for adding suffixes to
  application Kconfig fragment file names and devicetree overlay file names, see
  :ref:`application-file-suffixes` and :ref:`sysbuild_file_suffixes` for details.

* Deprecated ``CONF_FILE`` ``prj_<build>.conf`` build type.

Libraries / Subsystems
**********************

* Management

  * Fixed an issue in MCUmgr image management whereby erasing an already erased slot would return
    an unknown error, it now returns success.

  * Fixed MCUmgr UDP transport structs being statically initialised, this results in about a
    ~5KiB flash saving.

  * Fixed an issue in MCUmgr which would cause a user data buffer overflow if the UDP transport was
    enabled on IPv4 only but IPv6 support was enabled in the kernel.

  * Implemented datetime functionality in MCUmgr OS management group, this makes use of the RTC
    driver API.

  * Fixed an issue in MCUmgr console UART input whereby the FIFO would be read outside of an ISR,
    which is not supported in the next USB stack.

  * Fixed an issue whereby the ``mcuboot erase`` DFU shell command could be used to erase the
    MCUboot or currently running application slot.

  * Fixed an issue whereby messages that were too large to be sent over the UDP transport would
    wrongly return :c:enum:`MGMT_ERR_EINVAL` instead of :c:enum:`MGMT_ERR_EMSGSIZE`.

  * Fixed an issue where confirming an image in Direct XIP mode would always confirm the image in
    the primary slot even when executing from the secondary slot, now the currently active image is
    always confirmed.

  * Added support for retrieving registered command groups, to support registering and deregistering
    default command groups at runtime, allowing an application to support multiple implementations
    for the same command group.

  * Fixed an issue in MCUmgr FS management whereby the semaphore lock would not be given if an
    error was returned, leading to a possible deadlock.

  * Added support for custom payload MCUmgr handlers, this can be enabled with
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_MGMT_CUSTOM_PAYLOAD`.

  * Fixed an issue in MCUmgr image management whereby an error would be returned if a command was
    sent to erase the slot which was already erased.

  * Added support for image slot size checking to ensure an update can be utilised by MCUboot,
    this can be performed by using sysbuild when building both application and MCUboot by enabling
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_GRP_IMG_TOO_LARGE_SYSBUILD` or by use of bootloader information
    sharing from MCUboot by enabling
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_GRP_IMG_TOO_LARGE_BOOTLOADER_INFO`.

* File systems

* Logging

  * Added option to remove string literals from the binary when dictionary based logging is used.

  * Optimized the most common logging messages (strings with up to 2 numeric arguments). Optimization
    is done for code size (significant gain seen on riscv32) and performance.

  * Extended logging frontend API to optionally implement dedicated functions for optimized messages.
    Optional API is enabled by :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LOG_FRONTEND_OPT_API`.

  * Added support for runtime message filtering for the logging frontend.

  * Add option to have multiple instances of the UART logging backend.

  * Fixed userspace issue for :c:func:`printk` when :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LOG_PRINTK` is enabled.

  * Added compile time detection of logging messages which are using character pointers for ``%p``.
    It must be avoided when dictionary based logging is used and strings are stripped from the
    binary. When erroneous case is detected then user message is replaced with error message which
    suggests that pointer casting must be added.

  * Removed remaining references to v2 logging. :c:func:`log2_generic` renamed to :c:func:`log_generic`.

* Modem modules

  * Added ``TRANSMIT_IDLE`` event to the ``modem_pipe`` module which notifies the user of the pipe
    that the backend has transmitted all bytes placed in its buffer using
    :c:func:`modem_pipe_transmit()`.
    The event greatly increases the efficiency of transmitting large quantities of data if used to
    dynamically manage the delay between calls to :c:func:`modem_pipe_transmit()`.

  * Implemented ``TRANSMIT_IDLE`` event in all modem backends.

  * Extended all modem modules to utilize the ``TRANSMIT_IDLE`` event to dynamically manage the delay
    between calls to :c:func:`modem_pipe_transmit()`. This addition reduced the utilization of the
    system workqueue while transmitting large, continuous quantities of data, by 86%, while only
    reducing the throughput by 12%. This optimization additionally allows lower priority threads,
    like the deferred logging thread, to run during the transmission (it was blocked by the
    relentless, continuous calls to :c:func:`modem_pipe_transmit()`).

  * Improved ``modem_pipe`` event dispatching. The ``modem_pipe`` module now invokes the
    ``RECEIVE_READY`` event every time the pipe is attached using :c:func:`modem_pipe_attach()`
    if it has data ready to be read, and always invokes ``TRANSMIT_IDLE`` when the pipe is
    either opened or attached. This ensures event driven users of the modem pipe module can
    rely solely on the events to start read/transmit work. A test suite has been added to
    complement the improvements.

  * Extended ``modem_cmux`` module to support acting both as DTE (user application) and DCE (modem).
    With this addition, two zephyr applications can communicate with each other through their
    respective ``modem_cmux`` instances.

* Power management

  * Atmel SAM: introduced SUPC functions to allow wakeup sources and poweroff.
  * STM32F4 devices now support stop mode thanks to the use of a RTC based idle timer which
    keeps track of tick evolution while cortex systick is off.

* Random

* Retention

  * Fixed issue whereby :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_RETENTION_BUFFER_SIZE` values over 256 would cause
    an infinite loop due to use of 8-bit variables.

* Storage

  * File systems: LittleFS module has been updated to version 2.8.1.

  * Following Flash Map API macros, marked in 3.2 as deprecated, have been removed:
    ``FLASH_AREA_ID``, ``FLASH_AREA_OFFSET``, ``FLASH_AREA_SIZE``,
    ``FLASH_AREA_LABEL_EXISTS`` and ``FLASH_AREA_DEVICE``.

* Binary descriptors

* POSIX API

  * conformance: complete support for ``POSIX_THREADS_EXT``, ``XSI_THREADS_EXT``,
    ``POSIX_CLOCK_SELECTION``, and ``POSIX_SEMAPHORES`` Option Groups.

  * conformance: complete support for ``_POSIX_MESSAGE_PASSING`` and
    ``_POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING`` Options.

  * coverity: fix CID 211585, 334906, 334909, and 340851

  * documentation: improve structure and accuracy of POSIX docs

  * menuconfig: improved navigation and organization of POSIX options

  * pthread: allocate and free stacks with pthread_attr_t, embed attr in thread structure

  * pthread: support deferred and asynchronous thread cancellation

  * pthread: support stack sizes up to 8MB

  * samples: add dining philosophers sample app

  * semaphores: add support for named semaphores

  * shell: add a top-level ``posix`` command in the Zephyr shell. Zephyr shell utilities for
    the POSIX API can be added as subcommands (e.g. ``posix uname -a``)

  * timers: use async thread cancellation, add support for ``SIGEV_THREAD``, ``CLOCK_REALTIME``

  * unistd: add compile-time-constant sysconf() implementation

* LoRa/LoRaWAN

* RTIO

* ZBus

  * Renamed :kconfig:option:`ZBUS_MSG_SUBSCRIBER_NET_BUF_DYNAMIC` and
    :kconfig:option:`ZBUS_MSG_SUBSCRIBER_NET_BUF_STATIC`
    with :kconfig:option:`ZBUS_MSG_SUBSCRIBER_BUF_ALLOC_DYNAMIC` and
    :kconfig:option:`ZBUS_MSG_SUBSCRIBER_BUF_ALLOC_STATIC`
