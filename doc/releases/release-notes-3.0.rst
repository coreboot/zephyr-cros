API Changes
***********

Changes in this release

* Following functions in UART Asynchronous API are using microseconds to represent
  timeout instead of milliseconds:
  * :c:func:`uart_tx`
  * :c:func:`uart_rx_enable`

* Replaced custom LwM2M :c:struct:`float32_value` type with a native double type.

* Added function for getting status of USB device remote wakeup feature.

* Added ``ranges`` and ``dma-ranges`` as invalid property to be used with DT_PROP_LEN()
  along ``reg`` and ``interrupts``.

Changes in this release
=======================

Removed APIs in this release:

* The following Kconfig options related to radio front-end modules (FEMs) were
  removed:

  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_PA``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_PA_PIN``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_PA_POL_INV``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_PA_OFFSET``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_LNA``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_LNA_PIN``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_LNA_POL_INV``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_LNA_OFFSET``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_FEM_NRF21540``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_PDN_PIN``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_PDN_POL_INV``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_CSN_PIN``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_CSN_POL_INV``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_PDN_CSN_OFFSET``

  This FEM configuration is hardware description, and was therefore moved to
  :ref:`devicetree <dt-guide>`. See the :dtcompatible:`nordic,nrf-radio`
  devicetree binding's ``fem`` property for information on what to do instead
  on the Nordic open source controller.

* Removed Kconfig option ``CONFIG_USB_UART_CONSOLE``.
  Option ``CONFIG_USB_UART_CONSOLE`` was only relevant for console driver
  when CDC ACM UART is used as backend. Since the behavior of the CDC ACM UART
  is changed so that it more closely mimics the real UART controller,
  option is no longer necessary.

* Removed Kconfig option ``CONFIG_OPENOCD_SUPPORT`` in favor of
  ``CONFIG_DEBUG_THREAD_INFO``.

Deprecated in this release:

* :c:macro:`USBD_CFG_DATA_DEFINE` is deprecated in favor of utilizing
  :c:macro:`USBD_DEFINE_CFG_DATA`

* ARC


* ARM

  * AARCH32


  * AARCH64


* x86


Bluetooth
*********

* Audio

* Host

  * The :kconfig:`CONFIG_BT_SETTINGS_CCC_STORE_ON_WRITE` is enabled by default.
    Storing CCC right after it's written reduces risk of inconsistency of CCC values between bonded peers.

* Mesh

* Bluetooth LE split software Controller

* HCI Driver

Build and Infrastructure
************************

* Build system

  * New CMake extension functions:

    * ``dt_alias()``
    * ``target_sources_if_dt_node()``

  * The following CMake extension functions now handle devicetree aliases:

    * ``dt_node_exists()``
    * ``dt_node_has_status()``
    * ``dt_prop()``
    * ``dt_num_regs()``
    * ``dt_reg_addr()``
    * ``dt_reg_size()``

* Devicetree

  * Support for the devicetree compatible ``ti,ina23x`` has been removed.
    Instead, use :dtcompatible:`ti,ina230` or :dtcompatible:`ti,ina237`.

* West (extensions)


Libraries / Subsystems

MCUboot
*******

* Fixed serial recovery skipping on nrf5340.
* Fixed issue which caused that progressive's erase feature was off although was selected by Kconfig (introduced by #42c985cead).
* Added check of reset address in incoming image validation phase, see ``CONFIG_MCUBOOT_VERIFY_IMG_ADDRESS``.
* Allow image header bigger than 1 KB for encrypted images.
* Support Mbed TLS 3.0.
* stm32: watchdog support.
* many documentation improvements.
* Fixed deadlock on cryptolib selectors in Kconfig.
* Fixed support for single application slot with serial recovery.
* Added various hooks to be able to change how image data is accessed, see ``CONFIG_BOOT_IMAGE_ACCESS_HOOKS``.
* Added custom commands support in serila recovery (PERUSER_MGMT_GROUP): storage erase ``CONFIG_BOOT_MGMT_CUSTOM_STORAGE_ERASE``, custo image status ``CONFIG_BOOT_MGMT_CUSTOM_IMG_LIST``.
* Added support for direct image upload, see ``CONFIG_MCUBOOT_SERIAL_DIRECT_IMAGE_UPLOAD`` in serial recovery.
