Zephyr 3.7.0 (Working Draft)
############################

We are pleased to announce the release of Zephyr version 3.7.0.

This release is the last non-maintenance 3.x release and, as such, will be the next
:ref:`Long Term Support (LTS) release <release_process_lts>`.

Major enhancements with this release include:

* A new, completely overhauled hardware model has been introduced. This change the way both SoCs and
  boards are named, defined and constructed in Zephyr.
  Additional information can be found in the :ref:`board_porting_guide`.
* A long-awaited HTTP server library, and associated service API, allow to easily implement HTTP/1.1
  and HTTP/2 servers in Zephyr. Resources can be registered statically or at runtime, and WebSocket
  support is included.
* POSIX support has been extended, with all the Option Requirements of POSIX Subprofiling Option
  Groups now being supported for PSE51, PSE52, and PSE53 profiles.
* Bluetooth Host has been extended with support for the Nordic UART Service (NUS), Hands-free Audio
  Gateway (AG), Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP), and Audio/Video Distribution Transport
  Protocol (AVDTP).
* Sensor abstraction model has been overhauled to adopt a read-then-decode approach that enables
  more types of sensors and data flows than the previous fetch/get APIs.
* A new LLEXT Extension Development Kit (EDK) makes it easier to develop and integrate custom
  extensions into Zephyr, including outside of the Zephyr tree.
* Native simulator now supports leveraging native host networking stack without having to rely on
  complex setup of the host environment.
* Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) 2.1.0 and Mbed TLS 3.6.0 have been integrated into Zephyr.
  Both of these versions are LTS releases.
* New documentation pages have been introduced to help developers setup their local development
  environment with Visual Studio Code and CLion.

An overview of the changes required or recommended when migrating your application from Zephyr
v3.6.0 to Zephyr v3.7.0 can be found in the separate :ref:`migration guide<migration_3.7>`.

While you may refer to release notes from previous 3.x releases for a full description, other major
enhancements and changes since previous LTS release, Zephyr 2.7.0, include:

* Added support for Picolibc as the new default C library.
* Added support for the following types of hardware peripherals:

  * 1-Wire
  * Battery Charger
  * Cellular Modem
  * Fuel Gauge
  * GNSS
  * Hardware Spinlock
  * I3C
  * RTC (Real Time Clock)
  * SMBus

* Added support for snippets. Snippets are common configuration settings that can be used across
  platforms.
* Added support for Linkable Loadable Extensions (LLEXT).
* Summary of breaking changes (refer to release notes and migration guides from previous release
  notes for more details):

  * All Zephyr public headers have been moved to :file:`include/zephyr`, meaning they need to be
    prefixed with ``<zephyr/...>`` when included.
  * Pinmux API has been removed. Pin control needs to be used as its replacement, refer to
    :ref:`pinctrl-guide` for more details.

  * The following deprecated or experimental features have been removed:

    * 6LoCAN
    * civetweb module. See Zephyr 3.7's new HTTP server as a replacement.
    * tinycbor module. You may use zcbor as a replacement.

The following sections provide detailed lists of changes by component.

API Changes
***********

Removed APIs in this release
============================

 * The Bluetooth subsystem specific debug symbols are removed. They have been replaced with the
   Zephyr logging ones.

 * Removed deprecated ``pcie_probe`` and ``pcie_bdf_lookup`` functions from the PCIe APIs.

 * Removed deprecated ``CONFIG_EMUL_EEPROM_AT2X`` Kconfig option.

Deprecated in this release
==========================

 * Bluetooth advertiser options :code:`BT_LE_ADV_OPT_USE_NAME` and
   :code:`BT_LE_ADV_OPT_FORCE_NAME_IN_AD` are now deprecated. That means the following macro are
   deprecated:

    * :c:macro:`BT_LE_ADV_CONN_NAME`
    * :c:macro:`BT_LE_ADV_CONN_NAME_AD`
    * :c:macro:`BT_LE_ADV_NCONN_NAME`
    * :c:macro:`BT_LE_EXT_ADV_CONN_NAME`

    * :c:macro:`BT_LE_EXT_ADV_CODED_NCONN_NAME`

   Application developer will now need to set the advertised name themselves by updating the advertising data
   or the scan response data.

* CAN

  * Deprecated the :c:func:`can_calc_prescaler` API function, as it allows for bitrate
    errors. Bitrate errors between nodes on the same network leads to them drifting apart after the
    start-of-frame (SOF) synchronization has taken place, leading to bus errors.
  * Deprecated the :c:func:`can_get_min_bitrate` and :c:func:`can_get_max_bitrate` API functions in
    favor of :c:func:`can_get_bitrate_min` and :c:func:`can_get_bitrate_max`.

Architectures
*************

* ARC

* ARM

* ARM64

  * Implemented symbol names in the backtraces, enable by selecting :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SYMTAB`

* RISC-V

  * The fatal error message triggered from a fault now contains the callee-saved-registers states.

  * Implemented stack unwinding

    * Frame-pointer can be selected to enable precise stack traces at the expense of slightly
      increased size and decreased speed.

    * Symbol names can be enabled by selecting :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_EXCEPTION_STACK_TRACE_SYMTAB`

* Xtensa

  * Added support to save/restore HiFi AudioEngine registers.

  * Added support to utilize MPU.

  * Added support to automatically generate interrupt handlers.

  * Added support to generate vector table at build time to be included in the linker script.

  * Added kconfig :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_XTENSA_BREAK_ON_UNRECOVERABLE_EXCEPTIONS` to guard
    using break instruction for unrecoverable exceptions. Enabling the break instruction via
    this kconfig may result in an infinite interrupt storm which may hinder debugging efforts.

  * Fixed an issue where passing the 7th argument via syscall was handled incorrectly.

  * Fixed an issue where :c:func:`arch_user_string_nlen` accessing unmapped memory resulted
    in an unrecoverable exception.

Kernel
******

  * Added :c:func:`k_uptime_seconds` function to simplify `k_uptime_get() / 1000` usage.

  * Added :c:func:`k_realloc`, that uses kernel heap to implement traditional :c:func:`realloc`
    semantics.

Bluetooth
*********
* Audio

  * Removed ``err`` from :c:struct:`bt_bap_broadcast_assistant_cb.recv_state_removed` as it was
    redundant.

  * The broadcast_audio_assistant sample has been renamed to bap_broadcast_assistant.
    The broadcast_audio_sink sample has been renamed to bap_broadcast_sink.
    The broadcast_audio_source sample has been renamed to bap_broadcast_source.
    The unicast_audio_client sample has been renamed to bap_unicast_client.
    The unicast_audio_server sample has been renamed to bap_unicast_server.
    The public_broadcast_sink sample has been renamed to pbp_public_broadcast_sink.
    The public_broadcast_source sample has been renamed to pbp_public_broadcast_source.

  * The CAP Commander and CAP Initiator now no longer require CAS to be discovered for
    :code:`BT_CAP_SET_TYPE_AD_HOC` sets. This allows applications to use these APIs on e.g.
    BAP Unicast Servers that do not implement the CAP Acceptor role.

* Host

  * Added Nordic UART Service (NUS), enabled by the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ZEPHYR_NUS`.
    This Service exposes the ability to declare multiple instances of the GATT service,
    allowing multiple serial endpoints to be used for different purposes.

  * Implemented Hands-free Audio Gateway (AG), enabled by the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_HFP_AG`.
    It works as a device that is the gateway of the audio. Typical device acting as Audio
    Gateway is cellular phone. It controls the device (Hands-free Unit), that is the remote
    audio input and output mechanism.

  * Implemented Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and Audio/Video Distribution Transport
    Protocol (AVDTP), A2DP is enabled by :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_A2DP`, AVDTP is enabled
    by :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_AVDTP`. They implement the protocols and procedures that
    realize distribution of audio content of high quality in mono, stereo, or multi-channel modes.
    A typical use case is the streaming of music content from a stereo music player to headphones
    or speakers. The audio data is compressed in a proper format for efficient use of the limited
    bandwidth.

  * Reworked the transmission path for data and commands. The "BT TX" thread has been removed, along
    with the buffer pools for HCI fragments and L2CAP segments. All communication with the
    Controller is now exclusively done in the system workqueue context.

  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_PER_ADV_SYNC_TRANSFER_RECEIVER` and
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_PER_ADV_SYNC_TRANSFER_SENDER` now depend on
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_CONN` as they do not work without connections.

* HCI Driver

  * Added support for Ambiq Apollo3 Blue series.

Libraries / Subsystems
**********************

* Debug

  * symtab

   * By enabling :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SYMTAB`, the symbol table will be
     generated with Zephyr link stage executable on supported architectures.

* Management

  * hawkBit

    * The hawkBit subsystem has been reworked to use the settings subsystem to store the hawkBit
      configuration.

    * By enabling :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_HAWKBIT_SET_SETTINGS_RUNTIME`, the hawkBit settings can
      be configured at runtime. Use the :c:func:`hawkbit_set_config` function to set the hawkBit
      configuration. It can also be set via the hawkBit shell, by using the ``hawkbit set``
      command.

    * When using the hawkBit autohandler and an update is installed, the device will now
      automatically reboot after the installation is complete.

    * By enabling :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_HAWKBIT_CUSTOM_DEVICE_ID`, a callback function can be
      registered to set the device ID. Use the :c:func:`hawkbit_set_device_identity_cb` function to
      register the callback.

    * By enabling :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_HAWKBIT_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES`, a callback function can be
      registered to set the device attributes that are sent to the hawkBit server. Use the
      :c:func:`hawkbit_set_custom_data_cb` function to register the callback.

  * MCUmgr

    * Instructions for the deprecated mcumgr go tool have been removed, a list of alternative,
      supported clients can be found on :ref:`mcumgr_tools_libraries`.

* Logging

  * By enabling :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_NET_USE_DHCPV4_OPTION`, the IP address of the
    syslog server for the networking backend is set by the DHCPv4 Log Server Option (7).

* Modem modules

  * Added modem pipelink module which shares modem pipes globally, allowing device drivers to
    create and set up pipes for the application to use.

  * Simplified the modem pipe module's synchronization mechanism to only protect the callback
    and user data. This matches the actual in-tree usage of the modem pipes.

  * Added ``modem_stats`` module which tracks the usage of buffers throughout the modem
    subsystem.

* Picolibc

* Power management

* Crypto

  * Mbed TLS was updated to 3.6.0. Release notes can be found at:
    https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/releases/tag/v3.6.0
  * When any PSA crypto provider is available in the system
    (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CLIENT` is enabled), desired PSA features
    must now be explicitly selected through ``CONFIG_PSA_WANT_xxx`` symbols.
  * Choice symbols :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_LEGACY_RNG` and
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_EXTERNAL_RNG` were added in order
    to allow the user to specify how Mbed TLS PSA crypto core should generate random numbers.
    The former option, which is the default, relies on legacy entropy and CTR_DRBG/HMAC_DRBG
    modules, while the latter relies on CSPRNG drivers.
  * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_PSA_P256M_DRIVER_ENABLED` enables support
    for the Mbed TLS's p256-m driver PSA crypto library. This is a Cortex-M SW
    optimized implementation of secp256r1 curve.

* CMSIS-NN

  * CMSIS-NN was updated to v6.0.0 from v4.1.0:
    https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS-NN/latest/rev_hist.html

* Random

  * Besides the existing :c:func:`sys_rand32_get` function, :c:func:`sys_rand8_get`,
    :c:func:`sys_rand16_get` and :c:func:`sys_rand64_get` are now also available.
    These functions are all implemented on top of :c:func:`sys_rand_get`.

* Retention

* SD

  * SDMMC and SDIO frequency and timing selection logic have been reworked,
    to resolve an issue where a timing mode would not be selected if the
    SDHC device in use did not report support for the maximum frequency
    possible in that mode. Now, if the host controller and card both report
    support for a given timing mode but not the highest frequency that
    mode supports, the timing mode will be selected and configured at
    the reduced frequency (:github:`72705`).

* State Machine Framework

  * The :c:macro:`SMF_CREATE_STATE` macro now always takes 5 arguments.
  * Transition sources that are parents of the state that was run now choose the correct Least
    Common Ancestor for executing Exit and Entry Actions.
  * Passing ``NULL`` to :c:func:`smf_set_state` is now not allowed.

* Storage

  * FAT FS: It is now possible to expose file system formatting functionality for FAT without also
    enabling automatic formatting on mount failure by setting the
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FS_FATFS_MKFS` Kconfig option. This option is enabled by default if
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FILE_SYSTEM_MKFS` is set.

  * FS: It is now possible to truncate a file while opening using :c:func:`fs_open`
    and by passing ``FS_O_TRUNC`` flag.

  * Flash Map: TinyCrypt has been replaced with PSA Crypto in Flash Area integrity check.

  * Flash Map: :c:func:`flash_area_flatten` has been added to be used where an erase
    operation has been previously used for removing/scrambling data rather than
    to prepare a device for a random data write.

  * Flash Map: :c:macro:`FIXED_PARTITION_NODE_OFFSET`, :c:macro:`FIXED_PARTITION_NODE_SIZE`
    and :c:macro:`FIXED_PARTITION_NODE_DEVICE` have been added to allow obtaining
    fixed partition information from a devicetree node rather than a label.

* POSIX API

* LoRa/LoRaWAN

  * Added the Fragmented Data Block Transport service, which can be enabled via
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LORAWAN_FRAG_TRANSPORT`. In addition to the default fragment decoder
    implementation from Semtech, an in-tree implementation with reduced memory footprint is
    available.

  * Added a sample to demonstrate LoRaWAN firmware-upgrade over the air (FUOTA).

Trusted Firmware-M
******************

* TF-M was updated to 2.1.0. Release notes can be found at:
  https://tf-m-user-guide.trustedfirmware.org/releases/2.1.0.html

* Support for MCUboot signature types other than RSA-3072 has been added.
  The type can be chosen with the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_MCUBOOT_SIGNATURE_TYPE` Kconfig option.
  Using EC-P256, the new default, reduces flash usage by several KBs compared to RSA.

LVGL
****

LVGL was updated to 8.4.0. Release notes can be found at:
https://docs.lvgl.io/8.4/CHANGELOG.html#v8-4-0-19-march-2024

Additionally, the following changes in Zephyr were done:

  * Added support to place memory pool buffers in ``.lvgl_heap`` section by enabling
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LV_Z_MEMORY_POOL_CUSTOM_SECTION`

  * Removed kscan-based pointer input wrapper code.

  * Corrected encoder button behavior to emit ``LV_KEY_ENTER`` events correctly.

  * Improved handling for :samp:`invert-{x,y}` and ``swap-xy`` configurations.

  * Added ``LV_MEM_CUSTOM_FREE`` call on file closure.

  * Added missing Kconfig stubs for DMA2D symbols.

  * Integrated support for LVGL rounder callback function.

Tests and Samples
*****************

  * Added snippet for easily enabling UART over Bluetooth LE by passing ``-S nus-console`` during
    ``west build``. This snippet sets the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ZEPHYR_NUS_AUTO_START_BLUETOOTH`
    which allows non-Bluetooth samples that use the UART APIs to run without modifications
    (e.g: Console and Logging examples).

  * Removed ``GSM_PPP`` specific configuration overlays from samples ``net/cloud/tagoio`` and
    ``net/mgmt/updatehub``. The ``GSM_PPP`` device driver has been deprecated and removed. The new
    ``MODEM_CELLULAR`` device driver which replaces it uses the native networking stack and ``PM``
    subsystem, which like ethernet, requires no application specific actions to set up networking.

  * Removed ``net/gsm_modem`` sample as the ``GSM_PPP`` device driver it depended on has been
    deprecated and removed. The sample has been replaced by the sample ``net/cellular_modem``
    based on the ``MODEM_CELLULAR`` device driver.

  * BT LE Coded PHY is now runtime tested in CI with the nrf5x bsim targets.
