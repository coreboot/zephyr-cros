Architectures
*************

* ARC

* ARM

* ARM64

  * Implemented symbol names in the backtraces, enable by selecting :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SYMTAB`

* RISC-V

  * The fatal error message triggered from a fault now contains the callee-saved-registers states.

  * Implemented stack unwinding

    * Frame-pointer can be selected to enable precise stack traces at the expense of slightly
      increased size and decreased speed.

    * Symbol names can be enabled by selecting :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_EXCEPTION_STACK_TRACE_SYMTAB`

* Xtensa

Kernel
******

  * Added :c:func:`k_uptime_seconds` function to simplify `k_uptime_get() / 1000` usage.

  * Added :c:func:`k_realloc`, that uses kernel heap to implement traditional :c:func:`realloc`
    semantics.

Bluetooth
*********
* Audio

  * Removed ``err`` from :c:struct:`bt_bap_broadcast_assistant_cb.recv_state_removed` as it was
    redundant.

  * The broadcast_audio_assistant sample has been renamed to bap_broadcast_assistant.
    The broadcast_audio_sink sample has been renamed to bap_broadcast_sink.
    The broadcast_audio_source sample has been renamed to bap_broadcast_source.
    The unicast_audio_client sample has been renamed to bap_unicast_client.
    The unicast_audio_server sample has been renamed to bap_unicast_server.
    The public_broadcast_sink sample has been renamed to pbp_public_broadcast_sink.
    The public_broadcast_source sample has been renamed to pbp_public_broadcast_source.

  * The CAP Commander and CAP Initiator now no longer require CAS to be discovered for
    :code:`BT_CAP_SET_TYPE_AD_HOC` sets. This allows applications to use these APIs on e.g.
    BAP Unicast Servers that do not implement the CAP Acceptor role.

* Host

  * Added Nordic UART Service (NUS), enabled by the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ZEPHYR_NUS`.
    This Service exposes the ability to declare multiple instances of the GATT service,
    allowing multiple serial endpoints to be used for different purposes.

  * Implemented Hands-free Audio Gateway (AG), enabled by the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_HFP_AG`.
    It works as a device that is the gateway of the audio. Typical device acting as Audio
    Gateway is cellular phone. It controls the device (Hands-free Unit), that is the remote
    audio input and output mechanism.

  * Implemented Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) and Audio/Video Distribution Transport
    Protocol (AVDTP), A2DP is enabled by :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_A2DP`, AVDTP is enabled
    by :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_AVDTP`. They implement the protocols and procedures that
    realize distribution of audio content of high quality in mono, stereo, or multi-channel modes.
    A typical use case is the streaming of music content from a stereo music player to headphones
    or speakers. The audio data is compressed in a proper format for efficient use of the limited
    bandwidth.

* HCI Driver

  * Added support for Ambiq Apollo3 Blue series.

Boards & SoC Support
********************

* Added support for these SoC series:

  * Added support for Ambiq Apollo3 Blue and Apollo3 Blue Plus SoC series.

* Made these changes in other SoC series:

  * ITE: Rename the Kconfig symbol for all ITE SoC variants.

* Added support for these ARM boards:

  * Added support for Ambiq Apollo3 boards: ``apollo3_evb``, ``apollo3p_evb``.

* Added support for these Xtensa boards:

* Made these changes for ARM boards:

* Made these changes for RISC-V boards:

* Made these changes for native/POSIX boards:

  * Introduced the simulated :ref:`nrf54l15bsim<nrf54l15bsim>` target.

  * LLVM fuzzing support has been refactored while adding support for it in native_sim.

* Added support for these following shields:

Build system and Infrastructure
*******************************

  * CI-enabled blackbox tests were added in order to verify correctness of the vast majority of Twister flags.

  * A ``socs`` folder for applications has been introduced that allows for Kconfig fragments and
    devicetree overlays that should apply to any board target using a particular SoC and board
    qualifier.

  * :ref:`Board/SoC flashing configuration<flashing-soc-board-config>` settings have been added.

  * Deprecated the global CSTD cmake property in favor of the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_STD_C`
    choice to select the C Standard version. Additionally subsystems can select a minimum
    required C Standard version, with for example :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_REQUIRES_STD_C11`.

Drivers and Sensors
*******************

    limit to automatically start charging again.

* Battery backed up RAM

* CAN

  * Deprecated the :c:func:`can_calc_prescaler` API function, as it allows for bitrate
    errors. Bitrate errors between nodes on the same network leads to them drifting apart after the
    start-of-frame (SOF) synchronization has taken place, leading to bus errors.
  * Added :c:func:`can_get_bitrate_min` and :c:func:`can_get_bitrate_max` for retrieving the minimum
    and maximum supported bitrate for a given CAN controller/CAN transceiver combination, reflecting
    that retrieving the bitrate limits can no longer fail. Deprecated the existing
    :c:func:`can_get_min_bitrate` and :c:func:`can_get_max_bitrate` API functions.
  * Extended support for automatic sample point location to also cover :c:func:`can_calc_timing` and
    :c:func:`can_calc_timing_data`.
  * Added optional ``min-bitrate`` devicetree property for CAN transceivers.
  * Added devicetree macros :c:macro:`DT_CAN_TRANSCEIVER_MIN_BITRATE` and
    :c:macro:`DT_INST_CAN_TRANSCEIVER_MIN_BITRATE` for getting the minimum supported bitrate of a CAN
    transceiver.
  * Added support for specifying the minimum bitrate supported by a CAN controller in the internal
    ``CAN_DT_DRIVER_CONFIG_GET`` and ``CAN_DT_DRIVER_CONFIG_INST_GET`` macros.
  * Added a new CAN controller API function :c:func:`can_get_min_bitrate` for getting the minimum
    supported bitrate of a CAN controller/transceiver combination.
  * Updated the CAN timing functions to take the minimum supported bitrate into consideration when
    validating the bitrate.
  * Made the ``sample-point`` and ``sample-point-data`` devicetree properties optional.
  * Renamed the ``bus_speed`` and ``bus_speed_data`` fields of :c:struct:`can_driver_config` to
    ``bitrate`` and ``bitrate_data``.

    in milliseconds. Removed no longer used :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_WDT_NPCX_DELAY_CYCLES`.
  * Added support for Ambiq Apollo3 series.

* Wi-Fi

  * Added support for configuring RTS threshold. With this, users can set the RTS threshold value or
    disable the RTS mechanism.

  * Added support for configuring AP parameters. With this, users can set AP parameters at
    build and run time.

  * Added support to configure "max_inactivity" BSS parameter. Users can set this both build and runtime
    duration to control the maximum time duration after which AP may disconnect a STA due to inactivity
    from STA.

  * Added support to configure "inactivity_poll" BSS parameter. Users can set build only AP parameter
    to control whether AP may poll the STA before throwing away STA due to inactivity.

  * Added support to configure "max_num_sta" BSS parameter. Users can set this both build and run time
    parameter to control the maximum numuber of STA entries.

Networking
**********

* DHCPv4:

  * Added support for encapsulated vendor specific options. By enabling
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NET_DHCPV4_OPTION_CALLBACKS_VENDOR_SPECIFIC` callbacks can be
    registered with :c:func:`net_dhcpv4_add_option_vendor_callback` to handle these options after
    being initialised with :c:func:`net_dhcpv4_init_option_vendor_callback`.

  * Added support for the "Vendor class identifier" option. Use the
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NET_DHCPV4_VENDOR_CLASS_IDENTIFIER` to enable it and
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NET_DHCPV4_VENDOR_CLASS_IDENTIFIER_STRING` to set it.

  * The NTP server from the DHCPv4 option can now be used to set the system time. This is done by
    default, if :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NET_CONFIG_CLOCK_SNTP_INIT` is enabled.

* LwM2M:

  * Added new API function:

    * :c:func:`lwm2m_set_bulk`

  * Added new ``offset`` parameter to :c:type:`lwm2m_engine_set_data_cb_t` callback type.
    This affects post write and validate callbacks as well as some firmware callbacks.

* IPSP:

  * Removed IPSP support. ``CONFIG_NET_L2_BT`` does not exist anymore.

* TCP:

  * ISN generation now uses SHA-256 instead of MD5. Moreover it now relies on PSA APIs
    instead of legacy Mbed TLS functions for hash computation.

USB

Devicetree
**********

Libraries / Subsystems
**********************

* Debug

  * symtab

   * By enabling :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SYMTAB`, the symbol table will be
     generated with Zephyr link stage executable on supported architectures.

* Management

  * hawkBit

    * The hawkBit subsystem has been reworked to use the settings subsystem to store the hawkBit
      configuration.

    * By enabling :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_HAWKBIT_SET_SETTINGS_RUNTIME`, the hawkBit settings can
      be configured at runtime. Use the :c:func:`hawkbit_set_config` function to set the hawkBit
      configuration. It can also be set via the hawkBit shell, by using the ``hawkbit set``
      command.

    * When using the hawkBit autohandler and an update is installed, the device will now
      automatically reboot after the installation is complete.

    * By enabling :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_HAWKBIT_CUSTOM_DEVICE_ID`, a callback function can be
      registered to set the device ID. Use the :c:func:`hawkbit_set_device_identity_cb` function to
      register the callback.

    * By enabling :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_HAWKBIT_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES`, a callback function can be
      registered to set the device attributes that are sent to the hawkBit server. Use the
      :c:func:`hawkbit_set_custom_data_cb` function to register the callback.

  * MCUmgr

    * Instructions for the deprecated mcumgr go tool have been removed, a list of alternative,
      supported clients can be found on :ref:`mcumgr_tools_libraries`.

* Logging

  * By enabling :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LOG_BACKEND_NET_USE_DHCPV4_OPTION`, the IP address of the
    syslog server for the networking backend is set by the DHCPv4 Log Server Option (7).

* Modem modules

* Picolibc

* Power management

* Crypto

  * Mbed TLS was updated to 3.6.0. Release notes can be found at:
    https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/releases/tag/v3.6.0
  * When any PSA crypto provider is available in the system
    (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CLIENT` is enabled), desired PSA features
    must now be explicitly selected through ``CONFIG_PSA_WANT_xxx`` symbols.
  * Choice symbols :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_LEGACY_RNG` and
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_EXTERNAL_RNG` were added in order
    to allow the user to specify how Mbed TLS PSA crypto core should generate random numbers.
    The former option, which is the default, relies on legacy entropy and CTR_DRBG/HMAC_DRBG
    modules, while the latter relies on CSPRNG drivers.

* Random

  * Besides the existing :c:func:`sys_rand32_get` function, :c:func:`sys_rand8_get`,
    :c:func:`sys_rand16_get` and :c:func:`sys_rand64_get` are now also available.
    These functions are all implemented on top of :c:func:`sys_rand_get`.

* Retention

* SD

* State Machine Framework

  * The :c:macro:`SMF_CREATE_STATE` macro now always takes 5 arguments.
  * Transition sources that are parents of the state that was run now choose the correct Least
    Common Ancestor for executing Exit and Entry Actions.
  * Passing ``NULL`` to :c:func:`smf_set_state` is now not allowed.

* Storage

  * FAT FS: It is now possible to expose file system formatting functionality for FAT without also
    enabling automatic formatting on mount failure by setting the
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FS_FATFS_MKFS` Kconfig option. This option is enabled by default if
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FILE_SYSTEM_MKFS` is set.

  * FS: It is now possible to truncate a file while opening using :c:func:`fs_open`
    and by passing ``FS_O_TRUNC`` flag.

* POSIX API

* LoRa/LoRaWAN

* ZBus

Trusted Firmware-M
******************

* TF-M was updated to 2.1.0. Release notes can be found at:
  https://tf-m-user-guide.trustedfirmware.org/releases/2.1.0.html

* Support for MCUboot signature types other than RSA-3072 has been added.
  The type can be chosen with the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_TFM_MCUBOOT_SIGNATURE_TYPE` Kconfig option.
  Using EC-P256, the new default, reduces flash usage by several KBs compared to RSA.

Tests and Samples
*****************

  * Added snippet for easily enabling UART over Bluetooth LE by passing ``-S nus-console`` during
    ``west build``. This snippet sets the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_ZEPHYR_NUS_AUTO_START_BLUETOOTH`
    which allows non-Bluetooth samples that use the UART APIs to run without modifications
    (e.g: Console and Logging examples).

  * Removed ``GSM_PPP`` specific configuration overlays from samples ``net/cloud/tagoio`` and
    ``net/mgmt/updatehub``. The ``GSM_PPP`` device driver has been deprecated and removed. The new
    ``MODEM_CELLULAR`` device driver which replaces it uses the native networking stack and ``PM``
    subsystem, which like ethernet, requires no application specific actions to set up networking.

  * Removed ``net/gsm_modem`` sample as the ``GSM_PPP`` device driver it depended on has been
    deprecated and removed. The sample has been replaced by the sample ``net/cellular_modem``
    based on the ``MODEM_CELLULAR`` device driver.
