============================

Stable API changes in this release
==================================

* Bluetooth

    structure contains two members: ``handles``, which was moved from
    :c:struct:`bt_gatt_read_params`, and ``variable``.

* Networking

  * Added IPv4 address support to the multicast group join/leave monitor. The
    address parameter passed to the callback function was therefore changed from
    ``in6_addr`` to ``net_addr`` type.

Build and Infrastructure
************************

* Devicetree API

  * New "for-each" macros which work like existing APIs, but take variable
    numbers of arguments: :c:macro:`DT_FOREACH_CHILD_VARGS`,
    :c:macro:`DT_FOREACH_CHILD_STATUS_OKAY_VARGS`,
    :c:macro:`DT_FOREACH_PROP_ELEM_VARGS`,
    :c:macro:`DT_INST_FOREACH_CHILD_VARGS`,
    :c:macro:`DT_INST_FOREACH_STATUS_OKAY_VARGS`,
    :c:macro:`DT_INST_FOREACH_PROP_ELEM_VARGS`

  * Other new "for-each" macros: :c:macro:`DT_FOREACH_STATUS_OKAY`,
    :c:macro:`DT_FOREACH_STATUS_OKAY_VARGS`

  * New macros for converting strings to C tokens: :c:macro:`DT_STRING_TOKEN`,
    :c:macro:`DT_STRING_UPPER_TOKEN`

  * New :ref:`devicetree-pinctrl-api` helper macros

* Devicetree tooling

  * Errors are now generated when invalid YAML files are discovered while
    searching for bindings. See :ref:`dt-where-bindings-are-located` for
    information on the search path.

  * File names ending in ``.yml`` are now considered YAML files when searching
    for bindings.

  * Errors are now generated if invalid node names are used. For example, the
    node name ``node?`` now generates an error message ending in ``node?: Bad
    character '?' in node name``. The valid node names are documented in
    "2.2.2 Node Names" of the Devicetree specification v0.3.

  * Warnings are now generated if a :ref:`compatible property
    <dt-important-props>` in the ``vendor,device`` format uses an unknown
    vendor prefix. This warning does not apply to the root node.

    Known vendor prefixes are defined in
    :file:`dts/bindings/vendor-prefixes.txt` files, which may appear in any
    directory in :ref:`DTS_ROOT <dts_root>`.

    These may be upgraded to errors using the edtlib Python APIs; Zephyr's CI
    now generates such errors.

* Devicetree bindings

  * Various bindings had incorrect vendor prefixes in their :ref:`compatible
    <dt-important-props>` properties; the following changes were made to fix
    these.

    .. list-table::
       :header-rows: 1

       - * Old compatible
         * New compatible

    Out of tree users of these bindings will need to update their
    devicetrees.

    You can support multiple versions of Zephyr with one devicetree by
    including both the old and new values in your nodes' compatible properties,
    like this example for the LPD8803::

        my-led-strip@0 {
                compatible = "colorway,lpd8803", "greeled,lpd8803";
                ...
        };

* West (extensions)

    * openocd runner: Zephyr thread awareness is now available in GDB by default
      for application builds with :kconfig:`CONFIG_DEBUG_THREAD_INFO` set to ``y``
      in :ref:`kconfig`. This applies to ``west debug``, ``west debugserver``,
      and ``west attach``. OpenOCD version later than 0.11.0 must be installed
      on the host system.


Libraries / Subsystems
**********************

* Disk


* Management


* CMSIS subsystem


* Power management

  * The APIs to set/clear/check if devices are busy from a power management
    perspective have been moved to the PM subsystem. Their naming and signature
    has also been adjusted to follow common conventions. Below you can find the
    equivalence list.

    * ``device_busy_set`` -> ``pm_device_busy_set``
    * ``device_busy_clear`` -> ``pm_device_busy_clear``
    * ``device_busy_check`` -> ``pm_device_is_busy``
    * ``device_any_busy_check`` -> ``pm_device_is_any_busy``

  * The device power management callback (``pm_device_control_callback_t``) has
    been largely simplified to work based on *actions*, resulting in simpler and
    more natural implementations. This principle is also used by other OSes like
    the Linux Kernel. As a result, the callback argument list has been reduced
    to the device instance and an action (e.g. ``PM_DEVICE_ACTION_RESUME``).
    Other improvements include specification of error codes, removal of some
    unused/unclear states, or guarantees such as avoid calling a device for
    suspend/resume if it is already at the right state. All these changes
    together have allowed simplifying multiple device power management callback
    implementations.

  * Introduced a new API to allow devices capable of wake up the system
    register themselves was wake up sources. This permits applications to
    select the most appropriate way to wake up the system when it is
    suspended. Devices marked as wake up source are not suspended by the kernel
    when the system is idle. It is possible to declare a device wake up capable
    direct in devicetree like this example::

        &gpio0 {
                compatible = "zephyr,gpio-emul";
                gpio-controller;
                wakeup-source;
        };

    * Removed  ``PM_DEVICE_STATE_FORCE_SUSPEND`` device power state.because it
      is an action and not a state.

    * Removed ``PM_DEVICE_STATE_RESUMING`` and ``PM_DEVICE_STATE_SUSPENDING``.
      They were transitional states and only used in device runtime. Now the
      subsystem is using device flag to keep track of a transition.

    * Implement constraint API as weak symbols so applications or platform
      can override them. Platforms can have their own way to
      set/release constraints in their drivers that are not part of
      Zephyr code base.


* Logging

* MODBUS

  * Changed server handler to copy Transaction and Protocol Identifiers
    to response header.

* Random

  * xoroshiro128+ PRNG deprecated in favor of xoshiro128++

* Shell


* Storage


* Task Watchdog


* Tracing


* Debug

* OS


HALs
****

* HALs are now moved out of the main tree as external modules and reside in
  their own standalone repositories.


Trusted Firmware-m
******************

* Renamed psa_level_1 sample to psa_crypto. Extended the use of the PSA Cryptography
  1.0 API in the sample code to demonstrate additional crypto functionality.
* Added a new sample to showcase the PSA Protecter Storage service.

Documentation
*************

* Kconfig options need to be referenced using the ``:kconfig:`` Sphinx role.
  Previous to this change, ``:option:`` was used for this purpose.
* Doxygen alias ``@config{}`` has been deprecated in favor of ``@kconfig{}``.
