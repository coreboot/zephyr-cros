/**
 * @file
 * @brief SMP - Simple Management Protocol.
 *
 * SMP is a basic protocol that sits on top of the mgmt layer.  SMP requests
 * and responses have the following format:
 *
 *	 [Offset 0]: Mgmt header
 *	 [Offset 8]: CBOR map of command-specific key-value pairs.
 *
 * SMP request packets may contain multiple concatenated requests.  Each
 * request must start at an offset that is a multiple of 4, so padding should
 * be inserted between requests as necessary.  Requests are processed
 * sequentially from the start of the packet to the end.  Each response is sent
 * individually in its own packet.  If a request elicits an error response,
 * processing of the packet is aborted.
