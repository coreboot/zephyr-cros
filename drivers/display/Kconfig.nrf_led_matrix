	  Enable driver for a LED matrix with rows and columns driven by
	  GPIOs. The driver allows setting one of 256 levels of brightness
	  (where 0 means off completely) for each of the LEDs independently.
	  Assignment of GPIOs to rows and columns and the mapping of those
	  to pixels are specified in properties of a "nordic,nrf-led-matrix"
	  compatible node in devicetree.
	  The driver uses one TIMER instance and, depending on what is set in
	  devicetree, one PWM instance or one or more GPIOTE and PPI channels
	  (the latter value depends on the chosen pixel group size - the number
	  of LEDs in one row that can be lit simultaneously).
