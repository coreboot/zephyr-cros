config TEST_NUM_CPUS
	int "Number of CPUs to use in parallel"
	range 1 MP_NUM_CPUS
	default MP_NUM_CPUS
	help
	  The number of parallel threads to run during the test. The test
	  thread itself yields so that all cores have some probability of
	  causing racey behaviour.

config TEST_DURATION_S
	int "Number of seconds to run the test"
	range 1 21600
	default 5
	help
	   Duration for the test, in seconds. The range has a reblatively high
	   upper bound because we should expect that pthread_create() and
	   pthread_join() are stable enough to run for an arbitrarily long
	   period of time without encountering any race conditions.

	   Some exceptions apply, notably Qemu SMP targets.

config TEST_DELAY_US
	int "Microseconds to delay between pthread join and create"
	default 0
	help
	  If there is a race condition, a value of zero here should
	  cause a crash.

config TEST_STACK_SIZE
	int "Size of each thread stack in this test"
	default 512 if !64_BIT
	default 1024 if 64_BIT
	help
	  The minimal stack size required to run a no-op thread.

config TEST_KTHREADS
	bool "Test k_threads"
	default y
	help
	  Run tests for k_threads

config TEST_PTHREADS
	bool "Test pthreads"
	default y
	help
	  Run tests for pthreads

config TEST_EXTRA_ASSERTIONS
	bool "Add extra assertions into the hot path"
	default y
	help
	  On Qemu SMP targets, this can potentially lead to "scheduler noise"
	  leaking in from the host system, which can cause the test to fail.
