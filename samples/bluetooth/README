Bluetooth subsystem

= Architecture =

All processing is done in fibers. Basic structure for packet processing
is bt_buf. Packets are queued to different queues and processed. Packet
allocation is done through a free packets queue which gets populated
during the stack init.

= Building =

$ make -C host/src
$ make -C samples/bluetooth/<app>

= Testing =

Host Bluetooth controler is connected to the second qemu serial line
through a UNIX socket (qemu option -serial unix:/tmp/bt-server-bredr).

On the host side BlueZ allows to "connect" Bluetooth controller through
a so-called user channel. Use the btproxy tool for that:

$ sudo tools/btproxy -u
Listening on /tmp/bt-server-bredr

Now qemu can connect serial line to the 'bt-server-bredr' UNIX socket
with following command:

$ make -C samples/bluetooth/<app> NODE1.qemu
